# 01-Guessing
This is my first project for C220: A guessing game written in Python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about single data types and control structures.

The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player has multiple opportunities to guess the correct answer as it will provide feedback and inform you if your guess was to high or too low in relation to the correct number.
